# Studies in WiFi Ranging (and beyond)

This is a repo containing the code I created (or modified) while investigating using COTS Wi-Fi in a multi-robot SLAM system

- `rssi/` contains the code for rssi-based ranging
- `ftm/` cotnains code for fine time measurement based ranging
- `external/` contains tarballs for the FeitCSI and WSR codebases I modified
- `hostapd` contains hostapd configuration files I was trying to use for RSSI/FTM on linux laptop
